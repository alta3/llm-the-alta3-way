Create a Python program that calculates the average of a given list of numbers in Python. You should use a for loop to calculate the average without relying on built-in functions or libraries. The input is a list of numbers, for example: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], and the expected output is the calculated average, like: The average is 15. Ensure that your code is well-structured with clear variable names and includes comments to explain each step.
