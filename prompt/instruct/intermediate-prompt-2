Write Python code to calculate the total monthly revenue for a subscription-based service. 
The input is a dictionary containing subscription data. Each key-value pair represents a 
customer's subscription plan and monthly payment amount. Additionally, provide a list of 
customers who canceled their subscriptions that month, for example: ['Customer2', 'Customer4']. 
Compute the total monthly revenue, taking into account the canceled subscriptions. Ensure 
that the solution is implemented using a for loop to iterate through the subscription data.
Avoid using built-in functions or libraries for summing the values. Write clear Python code 
with descriptive variable names. Add comments to explain each step of the calculation, 
including how canceled subscriptions are accounted for.
