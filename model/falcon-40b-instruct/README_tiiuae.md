# âœ¨ Falcon-40B-Instruct

**Falcon-40B-Instruct is a 40B parameters causal decoder-only model built by [TII](https://www.tii.ae) based on [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) and finetuned on a mixture of [Baize](https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot). It is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.**

*Paper coming soon ðŸ˜Š.*

ðŸ¤— To get started with Falcon (inference, finetuning, quantization, etc.), we recommend reading [this great blogpost fron HF](https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon)!

## Why use Falcon-40B-Instruct?

* **You are looking for a ready-to-use chat/instruct model based on [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b).**
* **Falcon-40B is the best open-source model available.** It outperforms [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM), [RedPajama](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Base-7B-v0.1), [MPT](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b), etc. See the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).
* **It features an architecture optimized for inference**, with FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)) and multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)). 

ðŸ’¬ **This is an instruct model, which may not be ideal for further finetuning.** If you are interested in building your own instruct/chat model, we recommend starting from [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b). 

ðŸ’¸ **Looking for a smaller, less expensive model?** [Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct) is Falcon-40B-Instruct's little brother!

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import transformers
import torch

model = "tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto",
)
sequences = pipeline(
   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth. Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",
    max_length=200,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=10,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
)
for seq in sequences:
    print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")

```

For fast inference with Falcon, check-out [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)! Read more in this [blogpost]((https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). 

You will need **at least 85-100GB of memory** to swiftly run inference with Falcon-40B.



# Model Card for Falcon-40B-Instruct

## Model Details

### Model Description

- **Developed by:** [https://www.tii.ae](https://www.tii.ae);
- **Model type:** Causal decoder-only;
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English and French;
- **License:** Apache 2.0;
- **Finetuned from model:** [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b).

### Model Source

- **Paper:** *coming soon*.

## Uses

### Direct Use

Falcon-40B-Instruct has been finetuned on a chat dataset.

### Out-of-Scope Use

Production use without adequate assessment of risks and mitigation; any use cases which may be considered irresponsible or harmful. 

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Falcon-40B-Instruct is mostly trained on English data, and will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.

### Recommendations

We recommend users of Falcon-40B-Instruct to develop guardrails and to take appropriate precautions for any production use.

## How to Get Started with the Model


```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import transformers
import torch

model = "tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto",
)
sequences = pipeline(
   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth. Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",
    max_length=200,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=10,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
)
for seq in sequences:
    print(f"Result: {seq['generated_text']}")

```

## Training Details

### Training Data

Falcon-40B-Instruct was finetuned on a 150M tokens from [Bai ze](https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot) mixed with 5% of [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb) data. 


The data was tokenized with the Falcon-[7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b)/[40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) tokenizer.


## Evaluation

*Paper coming soon.*

See the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) for early results.


## Technical Specifications 

For more information about pretraining, see [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b).

### Model Architecture and Objective

Falcon-40B is a causal decoder-only model trained on a causal language modeling task (i.e., predict the next token).

The architecture is broadly adapted from the GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)), with the following differences:

* **Positionnal embeddings:** rotary ([Su et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864));
* **Attention:** multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)) and FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135));
* **Decoder-block:** parallel attention/MLP with a single layer norm.

For multiquery, we are using an internal variant which uses independent key and values per tensor parallel degree.

Falcon-40B-Instruct was trained on AWS SageMaker, on 64 A100 40GB GPUs in P4d instances. 

#### Software

Falcon-40B-Instruct was trained a custom distributed training codebase, Gigatron. It uses a 3D parallelism approach combined with ZeRO and high-performance Triton kernels (FlashAttention, etc.)
