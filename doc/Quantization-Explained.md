| Model | Quantization Method | Bitwidth | Perplexity (7B) | Perplexity (13B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| q2_k | Integer quantization | 2 bits | 6.7764 | 5.8545 |
| q3_k_l | Integer quantization | 3 bits | 6.4571 | 5.6033 |
| q3_k_m | Integer quantization | 3 bits, with mixed precision | 6.1503 | 5.2543 |
| q3_k_s | Integer quantization | 3 bits, with symmetric quantization | 6.0869 | 5.0869 |

As you can see, the perplexity of the models decreases as the bitwidth increases. This is because a higher bitwidth allows for more precise representations of the weights. However, a higher bitwidth also results in a larger model size.

The q3_k_m model achieves the best trade-off between perplexity and model size. It uses mixed precision, which means that some of the weights are quantized to 2 bits and the rest are quantized to 3 bits. This allows the model to achieve a lower perplexity than the q2_k model, while still being smaller than the q3_k_l and q3_k_s models.

In terms of real-world examples, the q3_k_m model could be used to power a mobile application that needs to generate text. The lower perplexity of the q3_k_m model would result in more accurate text generation, while the smaller model size would make it more efficient to run on a mobile device.

Here is an analogy to help you understand the difference between these models. Imagine that you are trying to build a model of a car. You could use a very simple model that only has a few parts, such as the wheels and the engine. This model would be very small, but it would not be very accurate.

On the other hand, you could use a very complex model that has all of the parts of a car, such as the wheels, the engine, the brakes, and the steering wheel. This model would be more accurate, but it would also be much larger.

The q2_k model is like the simple model of the car. It is small and efficient, but it is not very accurate. The q3_k_m model is like the complex model of the car. It is more accurate, but it is also larger.

The best model to use will depend on your specific needs. If you need a model that is small and efficient, then the q2_k model might be a good choice. If you need a model that is more accurate, then the q3_k_m model might be a better choice.
